              # 1. We pin the `JuliaCI/julia` plugin to a full commit hash.

              #    break when a new version of the plugin is released.
              # 2. We specify the Julia version up to patch, e.g. '1.7.3'.
              #    This is intentional. We don't do e.g. '1.7', because we want to make sure
