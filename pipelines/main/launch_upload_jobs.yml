              # A few notes:
              # 1. We pin the `JuliaCI/julia` plugin to a full commit hash.
              #    This is intentional. We want to make sure that this script doesn't suddenly
              #    break when a new version of the plugin is released.
              # 2. We specify the Julia version up to patch, e.g. '1.10.6'.
              #    This is intentional. We don't do e.g. '1.10', because we want to make sure
              #    that this script doesn't suddenly break when a new patch release of Julia
              #    is released.
